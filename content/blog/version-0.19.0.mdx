### #1: Translations

We're excited to announce that Fider has support for multiple languages and thanks to community support, it's now translated to English ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, Brazilian Portuguese ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª and French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·!

To change the language of your site, visit your site settings and select a different locale.

For this first release, only the public pages and e-mails are translated, all admin pages remain in English.

### #2: Design Refresh

There's been a significant effort put into Fider to make its interface consistent throughout all pages. A design system (inspired by Tailwind) has been created to accelerate and standardise the front end development. You can see it live here https://feedback.fider.io/_design.

### #3: Grace period to edit posts

This was a popular feature request for a long time and we're happy to announce that users now have 1 hour to edit their posts. This should allow users to enter additional information or reformat their post after seeing it live.

### #4: Server Sider Rendering

On the previous release we announced an experimental support for a better Server Side Rendering support which would improve SEO rankings because it's a lot faster and reliable than using Rendergun.

Starting from v0.19.0, Rendergun has been removed and the new SSR feature is enabled by default, there is nothing to configure, it just works.

### #5: Disable e-mail authentication

Another popular request on Fider was the ability to remove e-mail login. This is particularly useful for private, self-hosted Fider installations where there is only one OAuth option, which is usually the corporate sign-in method, so that only authorized employees can login.
