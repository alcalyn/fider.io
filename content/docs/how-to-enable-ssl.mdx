There are three options on how to configure SSL/TLS on your Fider instance.

### 1. HTTPS with a Reverse Proxy

This is often the most popular option as multiple reverse proxy supports TLS termination and various other useful features.
It's beyond the scope of this page to explain how to set it up, but these are the most popular options:

- https://traefik.io
- https://caddyserver.com
- https://nginx.com

### 2. Automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

Fider integrates with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) natively, so you can have TLS without installing anything else or buying your own certificate.

To enable it:

1. Ensure your app is NOT behind a proxy.
2. Add the SSL_AUTO to your docker-compose.yml
3. Restart your application.

```
version: '2'
services:
  db:
    ...
  app:
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:3000"
    environment:
      ...
      SSL_AUTO: "true"
```

It can take a few seconds on the initial request to generate a certificate, but after visiting your site, you'll should see the green lock and the certificate generated for you.

**NOTE**: You must enable firewall access on port 80 and 443. Fider will redirect all traffic from HTTP to HTTPS.

### 3. HTTPS with your own certificate

You can also buy (or generate) a certificate and use it on Fider. Copy your `.crt` and `.key` files into `/var/fider/etc/`, add the following to your docker-compose.yml and restart your application.

```
version: '2'
services:
  db:
    ...
  app:
    ports:
      - "443:3000"
    environment:
      ...
      SSL_CERT: filename.crt
      SSL_CERT_KEY: filename.key
    volumes:
      - /var/fider/etc:/app/etc
```
